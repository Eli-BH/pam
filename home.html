        <p>Established in the fall semester of 2019, the Photographic 
            Arts and Modelling club (P.A.M.) club of John Jay College
            of Criminal Justice is the epicentre of creative 
            experimentation of photography on campus. Our members 
            range from beginners to professionals, operating on both 
            sides of the camera as photographers and models. We pride 
            ourselves on being inclusive to beginners, offering tips,
            workshops, and resources to allow even the most novice photographer 
            feel like a pro. </p>

        <p>
            Our mission is to foster an environment of friendliness for the beginner photographers
            of John Jay College and provide a space for models and photographers to feel comfortable
            and encourage a habilitate for creativity and photography experimentation. We also aim
            to foster a lifelong love and curiosity of photography.

            We accomplish our goals of creative growth by holding workshops and tips meetings.
            We utilize the skills that we pick up on by having photo walks in various areas around
            New York City. On-campus, we provide a service to our fellow college clubs, by being 
            photographers for their events and for some official school events. Finally, we make 
            a point to stay in touch outside of campus, to foster photographer relationships that
            allow us to continue our growth long after the semester is finished.
